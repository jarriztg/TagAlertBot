# TagAlertBot
Telegram bot that notifies users when they are tagged in groups, 
with advanced features and multi-language support.

You can freely user the bot already running: @TagAlertBot (http://telegram.me/tagalertbot)

Written in Python 3 and powered by
[pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI).

Support my project and keeping up the server by donating 50 cents: http://paypal.me/pitasi.

This Readme file is a work in progress.

### Privacy
A lot of people asked for what is being logged and what I'm doing with these logs.

Just to be sure, I'm not reading all of your messages, they are a lot and I'm not going to waste my time doing this :)

_So, what I am logging?_ I log every message that triggers the bot: that means commands, tags, and people entering/leaving a group.

_Why you need to log all this stuff?_ I'm doing this just to be sure that bot is safe and not being used for flooding, spamming, etc.

_Where are the logs files?_ There are no logs files. I'm using an auxiliary bot to send to myself the logs.
This way I can be updated in every moment and check for users report even if I am not in front of my computer.

### Run the bot
First of all, you need to gather all the scripts in this repository.<br>
In your terminal just:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pitasi/TagAlertBot

Then open the folder just created:

    $ cd TagAlertBot

And make sure `main.py` is executable:
    
    $ chmod +x main.py
    
Finally, to run the bot:

    $ ./main.py
    
    
### How to be sure the bot doesn't restart or crash

I'm actually using [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) to be sure that my bot is turned on, even if some exceptions occurs.

     It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks.
